## About Desolate
Desolate is a short point and click story based game where the player is to wander around the world and try to find a way to escape. Collect artifacts, avoid danger and try to figure out what all this could mean, meanwhile trying to combat the ever expanding feeling of isolation that continues to grow within you. The true idea of Desolate is the feeling of loneliness that wandering around a world with no memory brings.
